## :clipboard: Explanation

The `reverse_bits` function takes a byte as input, reverses it bit by bit, and returns the result. Here's a brief overview of the implementation:

1. Initialize a variable `i` to 8, representing the number of bits in a byte.
2. Declare an unsigned char variable `res` and initialize it to 0. This variable will store the reversed bits.
3. Enter a loop that continues until `i` becomes zero.
4. Inside the loop, multiply `res` by 2 and add the remainder of the division between the input byte (`octet`) and 2. This effectively shifts the bits of `res` to the left and appends the least significant bit of `octet`.
5. Divide `octet` by 2 to right-shift its bits.
6. Decrement `i` by 1.
7. Repeat steps 4-6 until all bits have been processed.
8. Return the resulting reversed byte stored in `res`.

The function does not use any external functions or headers.

Allowed functions:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a function that takes a byte, reverses it, bit by bit (like the
example) and returns the result.

Your function must be declared as follows:

unsigned char	reverse_bits(unsigned char octet);

Example:

  1 byte

 0010  0110

 0110  0100
